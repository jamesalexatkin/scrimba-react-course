1. Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX when I 
   call `root.render()`?

    _In the root element._

2. What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code:
```
console.log(<h1>Hello world!</h1>)
```

    _A JS object for the JSX element._

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
root.render(
    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```

    _There needs to be a root element in the JSX._

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

    _The language specifies results, rather than implementation._


5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

    _It is made up of smaller components that can be reused and put together._
