1. What does the `.map()` array method do?

   _Performs some function for each element of an array._

2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?

   _Creating JSX components for each element of an array of input data._

3. Critical thinking: why is using `.map()` better than just
   creating the components manually by typing them out?

   _It scales to an arbitrary number of objects (particularly useful when interacting with APIs!)_
