1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?

   _A new parameter, or a callback function to set the parameter._

2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?

   _When you're just wanting to simply set the state to a new value._

3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?

   _When you need access to the previous state's value for computing the new state._
